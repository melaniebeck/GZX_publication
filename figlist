# Needed Figures
Machine Learning Curve -- justify "learned" decision
Machine FAILS on what?
Machine training/learning performance


# Figures that need desparate tweaking
The Horrible GZ Express "Schematic": this is all kinds of bad
SWAP fiducial model: "GZExpress" = "SWAP"
SWAP vote distributions: Need to verify these are even from the correct simulation
SWAP FAILED: this whole thing is hideous
Machine only performance: X axis is incorrect -- those are dates; not days!
